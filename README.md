# Unfocused Tags
A small simple script

### What is this?
This is a simple and relatively small script that displays text above players, showing if they are unfocused from the game right now or not.

### For Developers
Unfocused Tags allows you to disable the text rendering on specific or all individuals by using a clientside hook on clients named `ShouldDrawUnfocus`.
<br/>
This hook passes a `Player` as it's first argument and returning `false` in this hook stops the rendering on all or a specific individual.
